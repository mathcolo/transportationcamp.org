            <p>TransportationCamp provides an opportunity for every single attendee to be a participant in shaping and
                leading the event. Curious about how this will work? Read on for everything you need to know, including
                the process for proposing sessions, making your session appealing and how to pick and choose which
                sessions to attend on the day.</p>
            <h2>What&#39;s an unconference?</h2>

            <p>Transportation is an "unconference", not a conference. Rather than giving you the attendee a list of
                sessions to pick from, the sessions are programmed and led by the attendees. Unconferences
                are popular in the tech world because they reflect the culture of the industry—hands-on, flexible, a
                little casual but very hard-working. And usually, really fun.</p>
            <p>All sessions are open for attendees to define, describe, and lead. Session can take almost any form and
                can be about almost any topic, fun or serious. You can run your own, or indicate that you’re looking for
                collaborators. Possible formats include: a slide presentation followed by Q&amp;A, a panel discussion
                you have organized, a wide-open brainstorm, or any other arrangement of your design. It&#39;s important
                to make your chosen format clear, so that participants know what to expect ahead of time.</p>
            <h2>Making the most of your day</h2>
            <p>Unconference sessions have a lot of energy, and flexibility. But occasionally, they can be a bit
                frustrating. Here are some tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Remember the Rule of Two Feet:</strong> If you don't feel like you're engaged or the
                    session was not what you expected, you&#39;re free to walk out, and find a session
                    that fits you better. Don&#39;t stay in a session that doesn&#39;t work for you, move to another
                    session that needs your contributions. If you're running a session, don't be offended if people walk
                    out, either.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Speak up:</strong> if a session needs help, provide it. Feel free to give reminders about
                    time or topic focus.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Do it yourself!</strong> If you want a session to be different, maybe more technical, or
                    more policy focused, suggest it! Other people might feel the same way, and you&#39;ll help to
                    sharpen the focus for everyone.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Good stuff happens outside of sessions too.</strong> Unscheduled, informal
                    conversations in the hallways or at lunch are great for continuing off-shoots from sessions.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The Board</h2>
            <p>“The Board” is the central nervous system of the event. It&#39;s a grid, representing the available
                spaces (the rows) and planned time slots (the columns). Each box is a particular space at a particular
                time, the sticky note in each grid cell describes what the session will be, including topic, format and
                presenter.</p>
            <p>When the day starts, the board will usually be empty. At some events, organizers will solicit session
                proposals from attendees beforehand, but at most, all sessions are planned day-of. In the unconference
                tradition, participants propose sessions by writing them up (as described below) on
                large sticky notes. Then, an event organizer puts the session into a space on the board. We will try to
                spread sessions across the day evenly, making sure that similar or complementary sessions don’t go head
                to head.</p>
            <p>Use the Board to plan your day. Once individual sessions are up on the board, it's unlikely they will
                move around, but double-check just to be safe. Most Camps will also maintain an online version of the
                board, so you can also check the latest status of
                the board from your laptop or phone.</p>
            <h2>How to propose a session</h2>
            <p>Show up at TransportationCamp with your session in mind, or be inspired in the morning as participants
                introduce themselves. Grab a sticky note and
                describe your session&mdash;don’t be shy about it! You are interesting and your work is compelling and
                people
                will want to hear what you have to share. Your note must include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Session title</li>
                <li>Your name</li>
                <li>What kind of session it is (presentation, brainstorm, Q&amp;A, demos, hacking…)</li>
                <li>More info about the session—will it be technical? Are you open to co-presenting?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It helps if your sticky note is compelling (not just legible). If you have any time or equipment
                restrictions, indicate them on the back of the sticky. Here are a couple of great examples:</p>
            <p><img src="/assets/uploads/2011/02/board1-rot-300x224.jpg" alt=""> <img
                    src="/assets/uploads/2011/02/board2-rot-300x224.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <p>Give your session to the Board organizer. To start with, we&#39;ll put your sticky to one side, then we&#39;ll
                start scheduling the sessions once a critical mass of session proposals builds up. Each blank square in
                the board grid
                represents a session period in a particular room. When the session get scheduled, your sticky will move
                into a box on the board, representing a room and a
                time.</p>
            <p>Throughout the day, keep an eye on the physical or online versions of the board to plan which sessions
                you attend.</p>
            <h4>Merging sessions</h4>
            <p>Sometimes we need to merge your session with someone else's. Often, it's because you and someone else
                independently proposed a
                session on a particular topic. If possible, we will try to find both of you and talk it over first.
                Merging doesn&#39;t work so well if you both want to present on the topic,
                but it&#39;s great if you&#39;re both looking for a discussion. If you do agree to merge, work out who
                will provide the leadership needed to keep the session on track.</p>
            <h2>How to lead a great session</h2>
            <p>So, you proposed a fantastic session and it&#39;s up on the board. Congratulations! You&#39;re
                responsible for the session logistics and content, here are some tips for making the most of the
                session:</p>
            <h4 id="logistics">Logistics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Be there ahead of the start time, so you can welcome people and kick things off on time</li>
                <li>Start on time! This matters, you don&#39;t want to make people late for their next session. Ask a
                    volunteer for a time check if you&#39;re not sure.
                </li>
                <li>Finish on time (even if you start late!). We&#39;ll let you know if there are schedule
                    adjustments.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="content">Content</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If you&#39;re leading a session, you have responsibility for the content and format, and the
                    happiness of everyone participating. Be a leader, to manage the content as well as logistics.
                </li>
                <li>Make sure expectations are clear from the outset: if you&#39;re going to show slides for 45 minutes,
                    make sure everyone in the room is ready for that.
                </li>
                <li>Work towards tangible outcomes. A good start is for someone to take notes online, perhaps in a
                    shared Google doc. Maybe it also makes sense to collect contact details for a mailing list for
                    further discussion.
