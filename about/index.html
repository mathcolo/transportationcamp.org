    <h1>About</h1>
    <h4>TransportationCamp brings together thinkers and doers in the fields of transportation &amp; technology.</h4>

    <p>TransportationCamp is an unconference bringing together transportation professionals, technologists, and others
        interested in the intersection of urban transportation and technology.</p>

    <p>Transportation is a major metropolitan issue, with direct impacts on economic strength, environmental
        sustainability, and social equity. Recent advances in technology&mdash;mobile computing, open source software,
        open data and APIs, and spatial analysis&mdash;present an opportunity to improve mobility more immediately and
        at a lower cost than has ever been possible in the past.</p>

    <p>TransportationCamp raises awareness of this opportunity and builds connections between disparate innovators in
        public administration, transportation operations, information design, and software engineering.</p>

    <h4>What's an "unconference?"</h4>

    <p>This is not a traditional conference.
        The session topics and activities are suggested by the attendees.
        In addition to talks and presentations from big names in transportation and technology, TransportationCamp
        provides an opportunity for every attendee to be a participant in shaping and leading the event.
        Be prepared to get involved and meet </p>

    <p>Sessions may come in a variety of formats:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">birds-of-a-feather</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">lightning talks</a>,

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha">pecha kucha</a>, and others.</p>

    <p>Major themes reflect the backgrounds and interests of the participants.
        You'll find sessions about technology, policy issues, urban planning, and more.</p>

    <h4>History</h4>

    <p>TransportationCamp, the trailblazing transportation “unconference,” was first organized by
        <a href="http://openplans.org/">OpenPlans</a> with
        <a href="http://transportationcamp.org/events/east/">TransportationCamp East</a> held in New York City on
        March 5, 2011. Hundreds of enthusiastic participants
        descended upon New York Law School for that first camp to engage in networking and user-generated session topics
        ranging from “Fixing the Great Mistake… Reducing Car Traffic in NYC by 90% in 20 Years (10?)” to “What the Hell
        is a Smart Street?”</p>

    <p>Just two weeks later, OpenPlans produced
        <a href="http://transportationcamp.org/events/west/">TransportationCamp West</a> in San Francisco. This
        two-day program was held at Public Works SF and featured dozens of sessions with intriguing topics including
        “TDM 2.0” and “Sexy Transit.” Generous support from the Rockefeller Foundation was critical to organizing,
        publicizing and staging these events.</p>

    <p>In October 2014, OpenPlans passed the baton to <a href="http://www.mobilitylab.org/">Mobility Lab</a> to
        continue the tradition of TransportationCamp in Washington, DC, and to help facilitate events in other regions.
    </p>

    <p>In October 2019, Mobility Lab stepped back from its caretaker role. Each region's event is organized separately
        by dedicated individuals and organizations.</p>
